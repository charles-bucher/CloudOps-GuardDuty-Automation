# 🧼 Repo Hygiene: Terraform Binary Cleanup

This repo underwent a full history rewrite to remove oversized binaries and `.terraform` artifacts that were mistakenly committed during early development.

## 🔍 What Was Removed

- `.terraform/` directory (auto-generated, not meant for version control)
- `terraform-provider-aws_v6.19.0_x5.exe` (813MB binary that exceeded GitHub’s 100MB limit)

## 🛠️ How It Was Fixed

- Used [`git filter-repo`](https://github.com/newren/git-filter-repo) to surgically remove the binary from all commits
- Force-pushed the cleaned history to GitHub
- Re-cloned the repo to verify the cleanup

## 💡 Why This Matters

- ✅ Keeps the repo lightweight and fast to clone
- ✅ Prevents GitHub push errors
- ✅ Aligns with Terraform best practices
- ✅ Demonstrates real-world incident response and version control hygiene

## 🧪 Reproducibility

This repo now supports clean, reproducible Terraform workflows. All provider binaries and state artifacts are excluded from version control. See `.gitignore` for enforced exclusions.
